# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of a Twitter Sentiment Analysis project. The project aims to classify the sentiment of tweets as positive or negative using Logistic Regression.

## Files in the Repository

- **`trained_model.sav`**: The trained sentiment analysis model saved for future predictions.
- **`twitter_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code used for training and evaluating the sentiment analysis model. This notebook was developed using Google Colab.

## Dataset

The model was trained using the **Sentiment140** dataset, which consists of 1.6 million tweets. The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140), includes pre-labeled tweets for training sentiment analysis models. Each tweet is labeled as positive or negative, providing a large-scale dataset ideal for natural language processing tasks.

## About Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task where machine learning models are used to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) conveyed in a piece of text. In this project, the primary focus is on analyzing tweets to understand public sentiment on social media.
